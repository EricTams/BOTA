# Ship Asset Art Guidance - BOTA Maritime Trading Simulation

## Overview
STRICTLY top-down orthographic view ship tokens for game objects. Ships should be stylized maritime illustrations with clear, distinctive silhouettes for each faction - detailed enough to be visually interesting, but readable at small sizes.

**Critical Specifications:**
- **View Angle:** DIRECTLY TOP-DOWN (orthographic, bird's eye view, looking straight down)
  - NOT isometric, NOT angled, NOT perspective view
  - Like looking down from directly above the ship
  - Flat 2D representation as if the ship is lying on a table
- Size: 1024x1024 pixels
- Style: Stylized maritime illustration (clear, readable, but detailed)
  - NOT photorealistic, but can have painterly detail and texture
  - Balance between clarity and visual richness
- Background: Transparent PNG (required for Canvas rotation)
- Bow Orientation: Points UP (towards top of image, forward direction)
- Stern Design: Transom stern (square back) at bottom for clear directionality

---

## Ship Terminology

**Bow**: Pointed front of the ship (top of image, forward direction)
- Should have distinctive shape per faction
- Primary visual identifier when ship is moving
- Points in direction of travel
- Bowsprit, figurehead, or ram extends forward from bow

**Transom Stern**: Square or flat back of the ship (bottom of image, rear)
- Provides clear visual indication of ship's rear
- Traditional design for many sailing vessels
- Makes rotation direction obvious in gameplay
- Contrasts with pointed bow for clear directionality

---

## Critical Requirements for All Ships

### Canvas Rotation Requirements
- **Transparent background** - essential for rotation without artifacts
- **Clear, recognizable silhouette** - overall shape should be distinctive
- **Bow points UP** - ship rotates around center point in Canvas (0Â° = north/up)
- **1024x1024 size** - provides good detail at all zoom levels
- **Readable at small sizes** - must be recognizable at 32-64px display size

### Top-Down View Requirements (CRITICAL)
- **Deck visible from directly above** - you see the top of the deck, not the sides
- **Sails appear flat** - seen from above, sails are flat shapes (not showing sail face)
- **Mast appears as cylinder from above** - circular or slightly oval, not a full tall structure
- **No perspective depth** - all deck elements at same visual plane
- **Hull outline shows deck shape** - you see the deck perimeter, not hull sides
- **Flat orthographic representation** - looking straight down, like a map or architectural plan

### Visual Style
- **Stylized maritime illustration** - NOT photorealistic, but can have painterly detail
- **Rich textures acceptable** - wood grain, weathering, fabric textures add visual interest
- **Faction colors prominent** - color schemes should be immediately recognizable
- **Clear outlines** - ship should stand out against water/background
- **Detail that scales** - fine details are good, but major features must be visible at small sizes
- **Strong silhouette** - distinctive overall shape even at distance

### Directional Clarity (CRITICAL)
- **Pointed bow OR forward-extending element** - players must instantly see travel direction
- **Options for bow design (at TOP of image):**
  - Pointed/sharp bow, (figurehead/bowsprit/ram optional)
  - Round bow with figurehead/bowsprit/ram extending upward/forward
- **Mast positioning:** Masts should be vertical (perpendicular to deck) OR lean slightly towards the stern (bottom/back)
  - NEVER lean masts towards the bow (top) - this makes the ship look backwards
  - Slight backward rake (toward bottom) reinforces forward direction
- **Transom stern must contrast with bow** - square back (bottom) vs pointed/extended front (top)
- **Asymmetry is essential** - ship must have obvious "front" (top) and "back" (bottom)
- **Rule of thumb:** If viewing ship at 64px size, direction should be immediately obvious

## Generation Command Format

Use the Imagine tool in the Imagine/ folder:

```powershell
python Imagine/imagine.py generate "[PROMPT FROM ABOVE]" assets/ships/[FILENAME].png --size 1024x1024 --quality high --background transparent
```

**Important PowerShell Notes:**
- Use separate commands (do NOT chain with && or ;)
- Wrap prompts in quotes to handle spaces
- Ensure transparent background flag is always included

**Important Prompt Notes:**
- ALWAYS start prompt with "STRICTLY top-down orthographic view" or "direct bird's eye view"
- ALWAYS include "NO perspective or angle" to avoid angled/isometric views
- Emphasize "looking directly down from above" 
- Include "stylized maritime illustration with painterly detail" for richer visuals
- Request "realistic textures but clear readable silhouette" to balance detail with clarity

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Canvas Rendering
Ships are rendered using `ctx.drawImage()` with rotation transforms:
- Base orientation: bow points UP/NORTH (rotation angle 0 = north)
- Ship rotates around center point based on heading
- Rotation applied via `ctx.rotate()` before drawing
- Ships scale with zoom level but maintain aspect ratio
- Forward direction (bow) naturally points "up" on screen

### Display Sizes
Ships will be displayed at various sizes:
- Minimum: 32x32 pixels (zoomed out)
- Standard: 64x64 pixels (normal zoom)
- Maximum: 128x128 pixels (zoomed in)

Design must remain recognizable at all scales.

### Faction Color Coding
Primary faction colors at a glance:
- **Claddish Navy:** Navy blue, white, gold
- **Artifact Traders:** Purple, gold, arcane blue
- **Stonehall Merchants:** Gray, copper, brown
- **Slithereen Guard:** Teal, silver, aqua
- **Revtel:** Coral pink, turquoise, pearl white
- **Free Captains:** Black, blood red
- **Roseleaf Traders:** Green, gold, natural wood
- **Oglodi Raiders:** Blood red, bone white, iron gray
- **Keen Folk Engineers:** Brass, copper, industrial gray
- **Neutral:** Brown wood, generic (no faction colors)

## Future Tier 1-3 Ships

When generating higher tier ships for each faction:
- Follow tier progression guidelines above
- Maintain faction color scheme and aesthetic
- Increase size and detail appropriately
- Add tier-specific features (more masts, equipment, effects)
- Keep bow-down orientation and transom stern design
- Maintain board game token style throughout

---

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any ship asset:
- [ ] Transparent background (no white edges)
- [ ] Bow points DOWN (bottom of image)
- [ ] Transom stern visible at top
- [ ] Clear silhouette at 64x64 display size
- [ ] Faction colors prominent and recognizable
- [ ] Chunky board game style (not photorealistic)
- [ ] 1024x1024 resolution
- [ ] Distinctive from other faction ships
- [ ] Tier-appropriate detail level
- [ ] File named correctly matching ship_data.js

---

## AIDEV-NOTE: Art Guidance Maintenance

When adding new ships:
1. Follow tier progression system strictly
2. Maintain faction visual identity
3. Ensure each ship has unique silhouette
4. Test visibility at small display sizes
5. Keep board game aesthetic consistent
6. Update this guidance file with new specifications

Remember: Simple, bold, and readable beats complex and detailed for game tokens.
