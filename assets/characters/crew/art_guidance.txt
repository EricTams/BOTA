## Naming Convention

**Crew portrait files**: `crew_[class]_[faction]_[number].png`

Examples:
- `crew_warrior_stonehall_01.png`
- `crew_mage_artifact_01.png`
- `crew_rogue_freecaptains_01.png`
- `crew_sailor_claddish_01.png`
- `crew_merchant_roseleaf_01.png`

**Generic/neutral crew**: `crew_[class]_neutral_[number].png`

---

## Batch Generation Planning

To generate a full crew roster:

1. **Core crew (priority)**: 1 of each class for each faction (54 total)
2. **Variety**: 2-3 of each class for popular factions
3. **Quality tiers**: Mix of novice, skilled, expert for variety
4. **Legendary**: 1-2 legendary crew per faction (unique heroes)

---

## Design Principles

1. **Distinct from captains**: Less heroic/legendary than captain portraits
2. **Class clarity**: Visual cues immediately indicate class/role
3. **Faction identity**: Color schemes and aesthetics match faction
4. **Quality visible**: Higher tiers look more impressive
5. **Diverse appearances**: Variety in race, age, gender, appearance
6. **Painterly style**: Matches captain and overall game aesthetic
7. **Readable composition**: Face and key details clearly visible
8. **DOTA inspiration**: Reference Dota 2 character designs for style

---

## Usage in Game

Crew portraits appear in:
- **Tavern recruitment screen**: Available crew for hire
- **Crew roster screen**: Current crew members
- **Character details panel**: Individual crew information
- **Dice pool display**: Small icons showing which crew provide dice

---

## Data Integration

Crew portraits are referenced in `src/crew_data.js`:

```javascript
{
    crewId: "warrior_stonehall_01",
    name: "Thorgrim Ironbeard",
    class: "Warrior",
    quality: "Expert",
    faction: "StonehallMerchants",
    portrait: "assets/characters/crew/crew_warrior_stonehall_01.png",
    dice: [ /* dice pool */ ],
    recruitmentCost: 800
}
```

---

## Future Expansion

When game expands, consider:
- Unique named crew members with backstories
- Character progression (novice portraits upgrade to skilled/expert)
- Special event crew (quest rewards, special recruits)
- Seasonal or limited crew variants
- Crew relationships (paired bonuses for matching portraits)

---

## AIDEV-NOTE: Priority Generation Order

1. Generic portraits for each class (6 total - fallbacks)
2. One crew of each class for starter factions (Warriors, Mages, Sailors for Claddish/Artifact/Stonehall)
3. Expand variety within popular factions
4. Add quality tier variants
5. Create legendary unique crew members

Focus on functionality first, variety second.
