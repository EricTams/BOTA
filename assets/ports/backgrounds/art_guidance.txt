## Design Principles

1. **Immersive ground-level view**: Player is standing within the port looking at surroundings
2. **UI overlay compatible**: Background should work with semi-transparent UI panels overlaid
3. **Atmospheric depth**: Show background elements (ships, buildings) to create depth
4. **Faction identity**: Settlement backgrounds strongly reflect faction aesthetic
5. **Generic locations**: Location backgrounds are more neutral to work with any faction
6. **Painterly style**: Matches overall DOTA-inspired game art style
7. **Appropriate lighting**: Each background has lighting that matches its mood/theme
8. **No text or UI**: Pure background art, all UI elements added programmatically
9. **Widescreen format**: 1920x1080 for modern displays
10. **Readable composition**: Important visual elements shouldn't be obscured by UI overlays

---

## UI Integration

Backgrounds are used in:
- **Port entry screen**: Show faction settlement background
- **Trading screen**: Marketplace background or faction settlement
- **Shipyard screen**: Shipyard background
- **Tavern screen**: Tavern background (crew recruitment)
- **Town square**: Quest board, rumors, general information

**Implementation**: Loaded as Image objects and rendered in UI panels or as full-screen backgrounds with UI overlays on top.

## Technical Notes

- All backgrounds should support UI overlays with text visibility
- Avoid extremely busy areas in the center where UI panels appear
- Keep horizon line in upper third for compositional balance
- Ensure adequate contrast for text readability
- File sizes should be optimized for web delivery (under 500KB if possible)
- PNG format for quality, but optimize compression

## Test Files

**test_artifact.png** - Test background for development purposes

## AIDEV-NOTE: Batch Generation

To regenerate all backgrounds, create a PowerShell script:

```powershell
# generate_port_backgrounds.ps1
cd Imagine

# Faction settlements
python imagine.py generate "..." ../assets/ports/backgrounds/artifact_traders_settlement.png --size 1920x1080 --quality high --background opaque
python imagine.py generate "..." ../assets/ports/backgrounds/claddish_navy_settlement.png --size 1920x1080 --quality high --background opaque
# ... (continue for all factions)

# Locations
python imagine.py generate "..." ../assets/ports/backgrounds/location_marketplace.png --size 1920x1080 --quality high --background opaque
python imagine.py generate "..." ../assets/ports/backgrounds/location_tavern.png --size 1920x1080 --quality high --background opaque
# ... (continue for all locations)

cd ..
```

All detailed prompts are available in `generate_port_backgrounds.txt` in the root directory.

## Maintenance

When adding new:
- **Faction**: Create new settlement background matching faction colors and theme
- **Location**: Create new generic location background that works with any faction
- Update this guidance file with specifications
- Update port data to reference new backgrounds
- Test UI overlay visibility and text readability
