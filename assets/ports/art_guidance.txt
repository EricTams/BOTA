# Port Asset Art Guidance

## Overview
Top-down view port icons for faction cities/towns. Boardgame token style for readability.
Size: 1024x1024 pixels
Background: Transparent

## CRITICAL Design Requirements
1. **Water areas should be MOSTLY TRANSPARENT (alpha)** - So port water blends seamlessly with the sea map
2. **City wall around the perimeter** - Makes the port "pop" visually from the terrain
3. **Buildings and docks are fully opaque** - Only the water areas should be transparent
4. **Wall should be visible and distinct** - Defines the port boundary clearly

## Boardgame Token Aesthetic
**CRITICAL for all port art:**
- Simple, iconic designs - easy to identify at a glance
- Clear silhouettes - distinct shapes for each tier
- High contrast - buildings/walls stand out against transparent water
- Minimal detail - focus on key structures only
- Readable at small sizes (32-64px on screen)
- Painterly boardgame token aesthetic (not photorealistic)
- Each tier visually distinct by building count and wall complexity

## Tier System (Town/City/Capital)

Port tiers represent size and development level:

**Tier 1 (Town)**:
- 2-3 key buildings (simple shapes)
- Simple wall fortifications
- Simple dock to the left side
- Compact, easy-to-read layout

**Tier 2 (City)**:
- 4-5 buildings (one larger central structure)
- Stronger walls with corner towers
- Medium dock to the left side
- One grand structure visible (temple, market hall)

**Tier 3 (Capital)**:
- 6-7 buildings (grand centerpiece clearly visible)
- Massive walls with multiple towers
- Large dock to the left side
- Grand centerpiece dominates (castle, cathedral, palace)

## Generation Tips

1. Always use `--background transparent` for port icons
2. Size should be 1024x1024 for consistency
3. Use `--quality high` for best results
4. **CRITICAL: Include "boardgame token style" in every prompt**
5. **CRITICAL: Specify building count based on tier (2-3, 4-5, 6-7)**
6. **CRITICAL: Include dock on left side (simple/medium/large based on tier)**
7. **CRITICAL: NO ships in images - just the dock structure**
8. **CRITICAL: Specify water areas as "transparent" in prompt**
9. **CRITICAL: Always include city walls in prompt for visual "pop"**
10. Ensure "No text" in prompt to avoid AI-generated labels
11. Match painterly boardgame aesthetic to world map style
12. Keep faction colors visible and distinct
13. Buildings, docks, and walls should be fully opaque
14. Only water within port boundaries should be transparent
15. Emphasize "clear iconic silhouette" for readability
