- System can be enabled/disabled via MusicManager.setAmbientEnabled()
- Starts automatically when game begins playing
- Integrated with main audio system for volume control

Technical Details:

- Occasional sounds use random triggers with cooldown timers
- All sounds respect master volume and individual volume settings
- Audio nodes are cloned for overlapping playback support
