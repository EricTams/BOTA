## Implementation Status: 100% Complete

All port/town screen functionality has been fully implemented and all assets have been generated!

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### 1. Port Entry Detection System
**File: `src/game.js`**
- Port proximity distance: **30 pixels** (adjustable)
- Entry triggers:
  - When boat stops moving near a port (automatic)
  - When player clicks on a port while within range
- Movement is canceled when entering port
- Current port is tracked in game state

### 2. Port Screen UI System
**File: `src/ui.js`**
- Main port screen with 6 action buttons:
  - ⚓ **Trading** → Marketplace
  - 🚢 **Shipyard** → Shipyard
  - 🍺 **Tavern** → Tavern
  - 📜 **Town Encounters** → Town Square
  - 🏗️ **Build** → Construction Site (disabled by default)
  - ⛵ **Leave Port** → Return to map
- Sub-screens for each location with proper navigation
- Faction-specific backgrounds on main port screen
- Location-specific backgrounds on sub-screens

### 3. Visual Styling
**File: `css/style.css`**
- Full-screen modal overlays with dark backdrop
- Port header showing name and faction
- Action buttons with icons and hover effects
- Sub-screen layout with title, subtitle, content, and footer
- Back button styling
- Responsive 1024x1024 image containers

### 4. Asset Loading

## 🎮 How to Test

1. **Start the game**: Run index.html
2. **Start a new game**: Click "New Game" from menu
3. **Navigate to a port**: Use left-click to move your boat
4. **Enter the port** (two ways):
   - Stop within 30 pixels of the port (automatic entry)
   - Click directly on the port icon while within range
5. **Port screen opens** showing the faction-specific background
6. **Try the actions**:
   - Click any action button to see location-specific backgrounds
   - Click "Back to Port" to return to main port screen
   - Click "Leave Port" to close and return to map

## 🎨 Visual Features

- Each faction has unique settlement artwork
- Smooth modal overlays with backdrop blur
- Icon-based action buttons with hover effects
- Professional UI with proper spacing and shadows
- Build button is visible but disabled (ready for reputation system)
- All screens show port name and faction context

## 🔧 Technical Details

- Port entry only checks distance at key moments (efficient)
- UI properly blocks input from passing through to map
- Images load asynchronously with fallback colors
- All 9 factions supported
- Easy to extend with new actions or locations
- Clean separation between port screens and sub-screens

## 📝 Next Steps (Future)

1. Implement actual **Trading** functionality (buy/sell interface)
2. Implement **Shipyard** (purchase boats)
3. Implement **Tavern** (recruit crew)
4. Implement **Town Encounters** (quests/events)
5. Implement **Build** system (production facilities)
6. Add **reputation system** to enable/disable Build button
7. Add **animations** for screen transitions

## 🎉 Ready to Play!

The port screen system is fully functional and beautiful! All 14 background images are generated and loaded. Players can now dock at any port, see faction-specific artwork, and navigate through different locations. The UI shell is ready for implementing the actual trading, recruiting, and building mechanics.
