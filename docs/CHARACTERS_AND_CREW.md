## Strategy

### Balanced Crew
- Mix of Red/Green/Blue for all challenge types
- Versatile but not specialized
- Safe for general gameplay

### Specialized Crew
- Focus heavily on one color (e.g., all Blue for magic)
- Excellent at specific challenges
- Struggles with others

### Combat-Focused
- Heavy Red and combat icons
- Dominates violent encounters
- Less effective in diplomatic situations

### Diplomatic Crew
- Heavy Blue for persuasion
- Best prices and peaceful resolutions
- Vulnerable to attacks

### Navigator Crew
- Heavy Green for sailing challenges
- Navigate storms and hazards easily
- Fast travel and safe passage

## Future Enhancements (TBD)

- Crew relationships (bonuses for synergies)
- Crew backstories and personal quests
- Crew loyalty and morale
- Crew can leave if mistreated
- Romance options (?)
- Crew equipment/gear
- Training and mentorship system
