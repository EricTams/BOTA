3. **RESOURCES_AND_ECONOMY.md** - 6-tier resource system, production chains
4. **FACTION_SYSTEM.md** - Claddish Isles factions, reputation (no price impact)
5. **DICE_SYSTEM.md** - Dual-purpose dice (colors + icons), challenges
6. **CHARACTERS_AND_CREW.md** - Crew recruitment, dice pools, captain selection
7. **WORLD_SIMULATION.md** - Dual-loop system, city simulation, time controls
8. **AI_BOATS.md** - NPC behavior, trading AI, encounters
9. **EDITOR_MODE.md** - In-game map editor, collision painting, port placement
10. **GAME_PROGRESSION.md** - Victory conditions, difficulty, save system (auto-save only)
11. **BOATS.md** - Boat stats, types, faction-specific boats
12. **UI_SCREENS.md** - All game screens, navigation flow
13. **ASSET_GENERATION.md** - BOTA logo, map, ships, dice, portraits

### ✅ Key Design Decisions

**Game Core**:
- Real-time maritime trading simulation
- 52-week duration (score = final wealth)
- Continuous map (not grid-based), single large image
- Canvas-only rendering for all game objects
- Dual-loop: render (60fps) + simulation tick (adjustable speed)

**Factions** (Claddish Isles region):
- Claddish Navy (naval power)
- Artifact Traders (mystical commerce)
- Stonehall Merchants (dwarven crafts)
- Slithereen Guard (aquatic Naga)
- Revtel (aquatic reef dwellers)
- Free Captains (pirates)
- Minor factions: Roseleaf, Oglodi, Keen Folk

**Economy**:
- 6-tier resource system (40g → 60g → 90g → 135g → 200g → 300g)
- Production chains (raw → processed → combined → luxury)
- Dynamic pricing (±60% based on supply/demand)
- **No reputation price modifiers** (encourages exploration)

**Dice System**:
- Dual-purpose: Colors (Red/Green/Blue) for skills, Icons for combat
- Red = Strength, Green = Agility, Blue = Magic
- Crew members provide dice
- Re-rolls, locks, modifiers

**Save System**:
- **Auto-save only** (single save file)
- Continue button on start screen
- No manual save slots (simplified)

**UI**:
- BOTA logo: DOTA style with planks nailed over D, red B painted on
- Start → Captain Select → Main Map ↔ Port → Trading/Shipyard/Tavern
- Canvas for game objects, DOM only for UI chrome

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Code Implementation)
1. **Create index.html** - Basic HTML structure, Canvas element
2. **Create src/game.js** - Main game loop, state management
3. **Create src/renderer.js** - Canvas rendering system
4. **Create src/input.js** - Mouse/keyboard input handling
5. **Generate initial assets** - Logo, test map, simple ship token

### Short Term
- Implement basic map navigation (pan, zoom, boat movement)
- Implement simple port interaction (enter port, see menu)
- Implement basic trading (buy/sell one resource)
- Test game loop and rendering

### Medium Term
- Full resource system and economy simulation
- Dice system implementation
- Crew recruitment system
- AI boats basic behavior
- Faction system and reputation

### Long Term
- Editor mode
- All encounters and quests
- Balance and polish
- Sound and music
- GitHub Pages deployment

## Technical Stack

- **Platform**: HTML5, vanilla JavaScript
- **Rendering**: Canvas 2D (with optional WebGL painterly shader for map)
- **No frameworks**: Pure vanilla JS
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (static site)
- **Assets**: Generated via Imagine tool (OpenAI DALL-E)

## Development Principles

- ✅ Canvas-only for game objects (NEVER DOM elements)
- ✅ Functions under 20 lines
- ✅ Explicit parameters, no magic defaults
- ✅ Crash fast with clear errors
- ✅ YAGNI (implement only what's needed)
- ✅ Separate concerns (render, logic, input)
- ✅ PowerShell syntax for terminal commands

## Notes

- Map should be 8192x8192 (or maximum supported resolution)
- Ship tokens are simple top-down view, rotated via Canvas
- Painterly shader for map aesthetic
- No DOM manipulation for game objects (causes buggy animation)
- Dual-loop architecture allows independent render/simulation speeds
